# üåç Solar System Simulator using Pygame ‚òÄÔ∏è

* Welcome to the Solar System Simulator project! 
* Explore the wonders of our solar system right from your computer! 

## Overview üåå
This Python-based Solar System Simulator provides a dynamic and visually appealing representation of the inner solar system, featuring the Sun and four terrestrial planets. Built with Pygame, this project combines simplicity with accuracy, allowing users to explore the orbital dynamics of our Solar System.

## Features üöÄ
* **Realistic Orbits**: The simulator uses Euler method to accurately calculate and update the positions of the celestial bodies.
* **Interactive Controls**: Press 'Esc' key to exit the simulation and 'Space' key to pause the simulation.
* **Informative Display**: Simulation displays the names and distances for an educational and immersive experience.

## Getting Started üìñ
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/SpartificialUdemy/PSA.git`
2. Switch to current directory: `cd "M6 - Solar System Simulator"`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Simulator Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Add Solar System body in the simulator using [`create_bodies.py`](https://github.com/SpartificialUdemy/PSA/blob/main/M6%20-%20Solar%20System%20Simulator/create_bodies.py). You can add by using `add_solar_system_body`.
2. Feel free to change the [`parameters.py`](https://github.com/SpartificialUdemy/PSA/blob/main/M6%20-%20Solar%20System%20Simulator/parameters.py) depending on your system.
3. You can Add/Remove colors for the solar system bodies using [`colors.py`](https://github.com/SpartificialUdemy/PSA/blob/main/M6%20-%20Solar%20System%20Simulator/colors.py) depending on your preferences.
4. Run the simulator: `python main.py`
